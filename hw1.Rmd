## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
1. Create a folder named `ds202_hw1`, and **either** create an RMarkDown file `hw1.Rmd` under this folder **or** move the provided template into this folder. `hw1.Rmd` will include your solutions. The file and folder names are *case-sensitive*, which means `hw1.Rmd` and `HW1.rmd` are different. *It is crucial to follow the exact folder structure and file names* in this course, so that your homework can be reproduced. The correct folder structure is

```
ds202_hw1
|-- hw1.Rmd
|-- hw1.html (generated after knitting)
```

2. Write your name in the YAML of your homework `Rmd` file.

    Done

3. Write a paragraph to introduce yourself. Set your name in bold font and your major in italic. 

    My name is **Becca Barrick** and I am a junior at Iowa State. I am a *Marketing major* with minors in Public Relations and Data Science. I am pretty involved on campus, especially within my sorority. I look forward to learning more about Data Science and to working with my new study group. 
  
4. Write a paragraph describing a job that you think is related to data science. Include a hyperlink and an image. Make sure your answer is in a nice format to read. 

    There are many jobs related to data science. I tend to pay attention to jobs that relate to marketing and data science both. Some jobs that focus on both disciplines are a Marketing Analyst or Marketing Consultant position. These jobs look at the multitude of marketing data that a company receives and looks at how they can use said information to improve marketing and, therefore, sales. https://neuvoo.ca/neuvooPedia/en/marketing-analyst/ ![image](https://neuvoo.ca/services/content/_ext/img.php?id=158)
  
5. What data topic will you be most interested in? (Optional) Provide a source of such dataset if you have.

    I'm interested in data topics like crime statistics and music/movie sales. I like these topics because the data can potentially spread over many many years and it is clear to see how things have changed over a long period of time. 
  
6. To check that your R and Rstudio installation is correct, find the version of R by entering `version` into the R console. Include this command into a R code trunk in your solution `Rmd` file to have it automatically printed in the knitted html file. 

    platform       x86_64-apple-darwin17.0     
arch           x86_64

7. Install git. 
    - If you are on Windows: 
        a. Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). In the coming weeks we will use the Git Bash (but not the Git GUI). 
        b. After installation, set up Rstudio to use Git bash as the shell for the Terminal: Open RStudio, click Tools--Global Options--Terminal; under **Shells**, select Git Bash; click OK. 
        c. In the main menu of RStudio: click Tools--Terminal--New Terminal. If you have a `$` before your prompt, then you should be good to go.
    - If you are on Linux or macOS, Git has probably been installed by default, so you do not need to install anything. Just click the Terminal tab (above the R Console).

    Done
  
8. What is the version of your Git? To find out, go to the Terminal tab in RStudio (right to the Console tab), and type in the following command. If it works, this shows that the setup of your terminal and Git is correct. 
<!-- Then explore the bash command line and Git. -->

    ```
    git --version
    ```

    Answer: git version 2.20.1 (Apple Git-117)
  
9. Configure your git username and user email by modifying and entering the following commands into the terminal

    ```
    git config --global user.name "your first and last name"
    git config --global user.email "yourEmail"
    ```

    Done
  

10. Register a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account. What is your username?
